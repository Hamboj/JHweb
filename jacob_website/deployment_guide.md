#### Essential DNS Record Types

**A Record**: Points your domain to an IPv4 address
- Example: jacobhampson.com → 192.168.1.1

**CNAME Record**: Points your domain to another domain name
- Example: www.jacobhampson.com → jacobhampson.com

**MX Record**: Directs email to mail servers
- Example: jacobhampson.com → mail.google.com

**TXT Record**: Contains text information for verification
- Example: Used for domain verification and SPF records

### DNS Configuration by Provider

   - Access cPanel SSL/TLS section
   - Enable "Let's Encrypt SSL"
   - Select domain and install certificate

2. **Paid SSL Certificates**:
   - Purchase from hosting provider or third party
   - Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
   - Install certificate through cPanel

3. **Force HTTPS Redirect**:
   Add to .htaccess file:
   ```apache
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
   ```

### SSL Certificate Verification

#### Testing SSL Installation

   - Validity period: Typically 90 days (auto-renewal)
   - Encryption strength: 256-bit recommended

#### Common SSL Issues

**Problem**: Mixed content warnings
**Solution**: Ensure all resources (images, CSS, JS) use HTTPS URLs

**Problem**: Certificate not trusted
**Solution**: Verify certificate chain is complete, contact hosting support

**Problem**: Certificate expired
**Solution**: Check auto-renewal settings, manually renew if necessary

### Security Headers Configuration

Enhance security with additional HTTP headers:

#### Netlify Headers (_headers file)

```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
```

#### Apache .htaccess Headers

```apache
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
    Header always set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
</IfModule>
```

These security headers protect against common web vulnerabilities and improve your site's security rating.


## Performance Optimization

### Why Performance Matters

Website performance directly impacts:
- User experience and engagement
- Search engine rankings (Core Web Vitals)
- Conversion rates and business goals
- Mobile user satisfaction
- Professional credibility

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### Image Optimization

Your website includes several images that should be optimized:

1. **Image Compression**:
   - Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
   - Target: 80-90% quality for JPEGs
   - Convert to WebP format when possible

2. **Responsive Images**:
   ```html
   <picture>
     <source srcset="hero-image.webp" type="image/webp">
     <source srcset="hero-image.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
     <img src="hero-image.jpg" alt="Jacob Hampson" loading="lazy">
   </picture>
   ```

3. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Already implemented in your website
   - Images load only when needed
   - Improves initial page load time

#### CSS Optimization

1. **Minification**:
   ```bash
   # Using online tools or build processes
   # Removes whitespace and comments
   # Reduces file size by 20-30%
   ```

2. **Critical CSS**:
   - Inline critical above-the-fold CSS
   - Load non-critical CSS asynchronously
   - Improves perceived performance

3. **Font Loading Optimization**:
   ```html
   <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
   <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
   ```

#### JavaScript Optimization

1. **Minification and Compression**:
   - Remove unnecessary code and comments
   - Use Gzip compression on server
   - Consider code splitting for larger applications

2. **Async Loading**:
   ```html
   <script src="script.js" async></script>
   ```

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   ```javascript
   // Already included in your script.js
   window.addEventListener('load', () => {
     console.log('Page loaded in:', performance.now(), 'ms');
   });
   ```

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

#### Benefits of CDN

- Faster content delivery globally
- Reduced server load
- Improved reliability and uptime
- Better handling of traffic spikes

#### CDN Setup by Provider

**Netlify**: Built-in global CDN
- Automatic edge caching
- 190+ global locations
- No additional configuration needed

**Cloudflare** (for any hosting):
1. Create Cloudflare account
2. Add jacobhampson.com domain
3. Update nameservers to Cloudflare
4. Enable CDN and optimization features

**AWS CloudFront**:
- Advanced caching rules
- Custom edge locations
- Integration with other AWS services

### Caching Strategies

#### Browser Caching

Configure cache headers for different file types:

```apache
# .htaccess for Apache servers
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType text/html "access plus 1 hour"
</IfModule>
```

#### Service Worker Caching

For advanced caching, implement a service worker:

```javascript
// sw.js - Service Worker for offline caching
const CACHE_NAME = 'jacobhampson-v1';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/styles.css',
  '/script.js',
  '/assets/images/hero-bg.jpg'
];

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then((cache) => cache.addAll(urlsToCache))
  );
});
```
